# Portfolio website

This website was originally made in 2014, when I was 20 year old student. It's old and I hate the way its structured.

Occasionally I update it, but the bones of it are old. If you snoop around the source code for it, you're not getting a recent approximation how I make websites.

I'm planning to upgrade this to use a static site generator soon when I get round to it, but its not on the top of my list. Check out [the blog instead](https://blog.seedganggames.com).
