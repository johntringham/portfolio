			<p><i>Two Player</i> is a short single player video game about the social complexities of playing couch co-op video games. It includes multiple endings and
				branching dialog, which is controlled based on the choices you make in a in-game first-person-shooter, and shows how these choices affect the real life social situation you are in.</p>

				<i>"Two Player is a short, but sweet and oddly emotional little game that helps recreate fond (and some not-so-fond) memories of playing a bit of co-op with a friend. Itâ€™s a fun little game with charming dialogue and multiple endings to discover"</i> - Calum Fraser of Alpha Beta Gamer
