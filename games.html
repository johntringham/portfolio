<p class="subtit">Games</p>

<p>I have been making games and experimental visual programs for as long as I can remember. I learnt how to program back when I was 13-14, using Adobe Flash (then Macromedia Flash),
	in order to make games and visual experiments. 
	I've kept this hobby throughout my life.</p>

<p class="subtit">Two Player</p>

	<p><i>Two Player</i> is a short single player video game about the social complexities of playing couch co-op video games. It includes multiple endings and 
		branching dialog, which is controlled based on the choices you make in a in-game FPS, and shows how these choices affect the real life social situation you are in.</p>

<p>
	It was named in <i>Game Curators'</i> Game Of The Year: Game Jam Edition list, and was also featured in <a href="https://www.alphabetagamer.com/two-player-game-jam-build/"><i>Alpha Beta Gamer</i></a>
