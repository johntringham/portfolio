		<p>I have been making games and experimental visual programs for as long as I can remember. I learnt how to program back when I was 13-14, using Adobe Flash (then Macromedia Flash),
			in order to make games and visual experiments. 
			I've kept this hobby throughout my life.</p>

	<p><i>Two Player</i> is a short single player video game about the social complexities of playing couch co-op video games. It includes multiple endings and 
		branching dialog, which is controlled based on the choices you make in a in-game FPS, and shows how these choices affect the real life social situation you are in.</p>

</div>

<div class="row">

<p><i>Evaze</i> is an abstract 2D Arcade-Puzzle game, made in Unity.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">

<p>In <i>Evaze</i>, the player navigates a malleable labrynth - at any point a tile can be slid in and push all the other tiles accross, in order to create new routes to orbs and to block off enemies.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<p>Evaze is a casual mobile game. It was originally made as part of <i>Ludum Dare 47</i>, a biannual game development challenge to create a full game in 48 hours, but since then, I have fleshed it
out in order to make it a more complete mobile game. This includes visual polish and extra gameplay elements (power ups, extra game modes, etc)</p>
</div>

<p>You can play the original Ludum Dare version of the game for free in-browser <a href="https://zb.itch.io/evaze">on itch.io</a>. Development on the full mobile version of the game is complete and is
currently being prepped for Android and iPhone app stores.</p>
